<H3>Winter's Tale</H3>
<H3>SCENE II. Before LEONTES' palace.</h3>
<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter AUTOLYCUS and a Gentleman</i>
</blockquote>
<A NAME=speech1><b>AUTOLYCUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?</A><br>
</blockquote>
<A NAME=speech2><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=2>I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old</A><br>
<A NAME=3>shepherd deliver the manner how he found it:</A><br>
<A NAME=4>whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all</A><br>
<A NAME=5>commanded out of the chamber; only this methought I</A><br>
<A NAME=6>heard the shepherd say, he found the child.</A><br>
</blockquote>
<A NAME=speech3><b>AUTOLYCUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=7>I would most gladly know the issue of it.</A><br>
</blockquote>
<A NAME=speech4><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=8>I make a broken delivery of the business; but the</A><br>
<A NAME=9>changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were</A><br>
<A NAME=10>very notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with</A><br>
<A NAME=11>staring on one another, to tear the cases of their</A><br>
<A NAME=12>eyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language</A><br>
<A NAME=13>in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard</A><br>
<A NAME=14>of a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable</A><br>
<A NAME=15>passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest</A><br>
<A NAME=16>beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not</A><br>
<A NAME=17>say if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the</A><br>
<A NAME=18>extremity of the one, it must needs be.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter another Gentleman</i></p>
<A NAME=19>Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more.</A><br>
<A NAME=20>The news, Rogero?</A><br>
</blockquote>
<A NAME=speech5><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=21>Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the</A><br>
<A NAME=22>king's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is</A><br>
<A NAME=23>broken out within this hour that ballad-makers</A><br>
<A NAME=24>cannot be able to express it.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter a third Gentleman</i></p>
<A NAME=25>Here comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he can</A><br>
<A NAME=26>deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news</A><br>
<A NAME=27>which is called true is so like an old tale, that</A><br>
<A NAME=28>the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king</A><br>
<A NAME=29>found his heir?</A><br>
</blockquote>
<A NAME=speech6><b>Third Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=30>Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by</A><br>
<A NAME=31>circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you</A><br>
<A NAME=32>see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle</A><br>
<A NAME=33>of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,</A><br>
<A NAME=34>the letters of Antigonus found with it which they</A><br>
<A NAME=35>know to be his character, the majesty of the</A><br>
<A NAME=36>creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection</A><br>
<A NAME=37>of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,</A><br>
<A NAME=38>and many other evidences proclaim her with all</A><br>
<A NAME=39>certainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see</A><br>
<A NAME=40>the meeting of the two kings?</A><br>
