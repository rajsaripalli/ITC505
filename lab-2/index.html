<H3>SCENE II. Before LEONTES' palace.</h3>

<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter AUTOLYCUS and a Gentleman</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>AUTOLYCUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=2>I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old</A><br>
<A NAME=3>shepherd deliver the manner how he found it:</A><br>
<A NAME=4>whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all</A><br>
<A NAME=5>commanded out of the chamber; only this methought I</A><br>
<A NAME=6>heard the shepherd say, he found the child.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>AUTOLYCUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=7>I would most gladly know the issue of it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=8>I make a broken delivery of the business; but the</A><br>
<A NAME=9>changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were</A><br>
<A NAME=10>very notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with</A><br>
<A NAME=11>staring on one another, to tear the cases of their</A><br>
<A NAME=12>eyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language</A><br>
<A NAME=13>in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard</A><br>
<A NAME=14>of a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable</A><br>
<A NAME=15>passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest</A><br>
<A NAME=16>beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not</A><br>
<A NAME=17>say if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the</A><br>
<A NAME=18>extremity of the one, it must needs be.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter another Gentleman</i></p>
<A NAME=19>Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more.</A><br>
<A NAME=20>The news, Rogero?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=21>Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the</A><br>
<A NAME=22>king's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is</A><br>
<A NAME=23>broken out within this hour that ballad-makers</A><br>
<A NAME=24>cannot be able to express it.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter a third Gentleman</i></p>
<A NAME=25>Here comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he can</A><br>
<A NAME=26>deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news</A><br>
<A NAME=27>which is called true is so like an old tale, that</A><br>
<A NAME=28>the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king</A><br>
<A NAME=29>found his heir?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>Third Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=30>Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by</A><br>
<A NAME=31>circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you</A><br>
<A NAME=32>see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle</A><br>
<A NAME=33>of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,</A><br>
<A NAME=34>the letters of Antigonus found with it which they</A><br>
<A NAME=35>know to be his character, the majesty of the</A><br>
<A NAME=36>creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection</A><br>
<A NAME=37>of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,</A><br>
<A NAME=38>and many other evidences proclaim her with all</A><br>
<A NAME=39>certainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see</A><br>
<A NAME=40>the meeting of the two kings?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=41>No.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>Third Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=42>Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,</A><br>
<A NAME=43>cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one</A><br>
<A NAME=44>joy crown another, so and in such manner that it</A><br>
<A NAME=45>seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their</A><br>
<A NAME=46>joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,</A><br>
<A NAME=47>holding up of hands, with countenances of such</A><br>
<A NAME=48>distraction that they were to be known by garment,</A><br>
<A NAME=49>not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of</A><br>
<A NAME=50>himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that</A><br>
<A NAME=51>joy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother,</A><br>
<A NAME=52>thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then</A><br>
<A NAME=53>embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his</A><br>
<A NAME=54>daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old</A><br>
<A NAME=55>shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten</A><br>
<A NAME=56>conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such</A><br>
<A NAME=57>another encounter, which lames report to follow it</A><br>
<A NAME=58>and undoes description to do it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=59>What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried</A><br>
<A NAME=60>hence the child?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>Third Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=61>Like an old tale still, which will have matter to</A><br>
<A NAME=62>rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear</A><br>
<A NAME=63>open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this</A><br>
<A NAME=64>avouches the shepherd's son; who has not only his</A><br>
<A NAME=65>innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a</A><br>
<A NAME=66>handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=67>What became of his bark and his followers?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>Third Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=68>Wrecked the same instant of their master's death and</A><br>
<A NAME=69>in the view of the shepherd: so that all the</A><br>
<A NAME=70>instruments which aided to expose the child were</A><br>
<A NAME=71>even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble</A><br>
<A NAME=72>combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in</A><br>
<A NAME=73>Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of</A><br>
<A NAME=74>her husband, another elevated that the oracle was</A><br>
<A NAME=75>fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,</A><br>
<A NAME=76>and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin</A><br>
<A NAME=77>her to her heart that she might no more be in danger</A><br>
<A NAME=78>of losing.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=79>The dignity of this act was worth the audience of</A><br>
<A NAME=80>kings and princes; for by such was it acted.</A><br>

    <h2>Addendum</h2>
    <p>The structural choices I made in this HTML were all about making the content clear and easy to read while also presenting the dialogue of *The Winter's Tale* in a smooth, engaging way. To make each character’s speech stand out, I used the blockquote tag. This helps separate each dialogue, making it obvious who’s speaking, which is especially important for a play where multiple characters interact in quick succession.</p>
    
    <p>To make it even easier for readers to navigate the scene, I added anchor tags to each line of dialogue. These act like little bookmarks, allowing people to jump to specific lines if they want to. This is a great feature for accessibility and helps readers quickly find the parts they’re interested in. I also used the h3 tag to highlight the scene title and the b tag to emphasize the character names. These tags make it clear who’s talking and where they are in the scene.</p>

    <p>Another addition was the footer, which shows when the page was last updated. Since plays like *The Winter’s Tale* are often studied or updated over time, knowing the last modification date gives important context to the reader. I also included a script tag that automatically updates this date, which adds a nice touch of interactivity to the page.</p>

    <p>Lastly, I placed the addendum at the end of the page but before the footer, so it wouldn’t interrupt the flow of the play itself. This ensures it’s easy to find if someone wants to read about the design choices, but it won’t take away from the experience of the play. Overall, the decisions I made aim to create a clean, user-friendly layout that’s both functional and visually pleasing.</p>
